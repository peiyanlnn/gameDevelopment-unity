This game is designed for learning basic vocabularies. The game was developed by Unity 3D and added some scripts to make it more interesting.

 

### Theme and Narrative

This is an educational themed game that aims to teach users the basics of vocabulary and learn how to pronounce and spell words. In the game, I designed a player model that interacts with NPCs by moving it, enhancing the gaming experience.

### Education / Al Co-learning

The game is designed with different levels of difficulty. Starting from level 0, players can quickly learn how to play this game. As the difficulty of the game increases, players need to recognize more and more words. At the end of each level, I designed a quiz to test the player's learning progress.

During the game, I designed actions and state changes for NPCs. And added scripts and sound components for them. During the learning process, the panel on the screen will prompt the current game situation and guide players to operate.

### Game / Physics

In addition to the internal components of Unity, I also designed some unique features using scripts. For example, when hitting an NPC, other objects will be automatically created and corresponding scripts will be attached to these objects to design their reactions.

### Devices/ HCl

This game can be run on different platforms. Currently, it can run on both PC and Android phones. On the PC side, the game can control character movement through the keyboard AWSD, or by dragging a virtual joystick with the mouse to control character movement. On the Android platform, games can be controlled through virtual joysticks, making it easy for mobile users to operate.
